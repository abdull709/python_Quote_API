Description:
Quote machine is a simple program design in python to fetch and display quotes from a quote API. The application uses random quotation API to get random quote, random quotes, list the quotes, list the authors, list the topics that the quotes cover and search quotes and authors, this program can be use by anyone who want to get quotes or know much about the popular quote authors. 

How to Use:
Firstly the program contains to modules to aid readability and ease of use the portfolio.py which contains class attributes and methods for the program and the quote.py which contains instructions to run the program.
1)	Visit the link provided above.
2)	While the two modules are in the same file click the quote.py and click the “Run” button.
3)	Once prompted, enter the name of your choice from the list of instructions provided in the program.
4)	Else if you are searching for an author or quote you will be prompted again to provide the author name or quote you are looking for. 
5)	The program will display the data related to your choice 3 and 4. 
6)	To exit the program, simply write quit when you are prompted to input your choice.

Technical Details:
Class with attributes and method has been defined for different tasks such as fetching data and displaying results. This approach allows for easy addition of features in the future. Added error handling for cases when a user enters a wrong choice that is not found in the API database or when there is no internet connection. Comprehensive comments have been added throughout the code using ”Docstring” in the class and methods and provided instructions to explain each step and its purpose. Moreover, variable names have been chosen to be descriptive, enhancing code clarity, I enable user to automatically download the content of the quote on to his clipboard which will enable ease of usage to the user and finally a timer was added to reduce the amount of time the user should wait to receive the API.

Future Plans:
Provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI): which will enable user with more convenient and interactive way of using the program.
Display a random quote every day: for user motivation in carrying out his daily schedules and events.
